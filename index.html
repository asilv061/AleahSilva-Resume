        <div class="subheading mb-5">Information Systems</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I currently am nineteen years old and I am currently enrolled at the University of California, Riverside as a pre-business student. This is my second year at the University of California, Riverside and I plan on applying to the School of Business by the end of my second year or sooner so I can further my education quickly and effeciently and get my Bachelor's degree in Business. I want to concentrate in information systems so that is why I plan on getting an internship in this field to see if I really love what I am majoring in. <br><br>
        I am currently looking for an internship in information systems to gain experience and learn more about business. I would love to have an internship by this summer because the more experience I have the better. I plan to graduate in June 2023 and when I graduate I plan to be a data analyst or anything that is in my major. Being a Data Analyst is my top job though and the one I really want to do. While I am working as a data analyst or whatever job I have at the moment I also want to go back to school after a year of taking a break to get my Master's degree in Business.<br><br>
        After I get my Master's degree I would like to work myself up and later become a Senior Data Analyst or anything above a Data Analyst. I am currently working at Transportation Services at the University, this job has taught me many new skills and responsibilities. I am very grateful to have this job and enjoy it greatly. At transportation services, we do many different jobs such as wash cars and golf carts, give temporary parking permits, help people who are new to campus, and help with events. Transportation services help me become more social and comfortable with being able to speak publicly. I also transport customers to locations that they need to go to if hurt.<br><br>
        Before my job now I catered for a restaurant in Glendora. This job taught me customer service, organization, planning, and helped me resolve conflicts more efficiently. Another job I had prior was working at my church, though it was voluntary it was a job. Here I managed a group of children and led them to take the next steps in our religion. This job helped me be better at working under pressure. I plan on looking for another job now that is more towards my field in business such as working at the bank or anything else that can help me in my major. I have a love for the outdoors, art, technology, and helping others. In my free time, I like to go on hikes around my area. I also like to go to museums around my area when I am not busy with school. I also love to travel, and I plan on traveling when I graduate with my Bachelor's degree to see the rest of the world.<br><br>
